## 1. Introduction

This project was the second of the year and the first managed by the alpha class and the first for a real client.

Our first client is a luxury jewellery group called 'Dubail'.

Dubail wanted a mobile application coded in HTML CSS and JavaScript where it is possible to customise different types of jewels with different metal and stone.

This report is a condensed version of our 6 week project. This report is separated in different parts with the different pages of the app.

## 2. Technologies Used

During this project we learned and use some technologies to finish the project

-Languages

    - HTML
    - JavaScript
    - CSS

-Github

    - Git

-Centralise by

    - visual studio code

## 3. GitHub Setup

We used the platform GitHub to work in group and send the work we done to centralise it on one project so we can 'Push' us work and 'Pull' when someone finish a task to compile it,

We used the GitHub Desktop application for it,

## 4. Artistic Direction

We took inspiration from Apple for the front page. The graphic style of the page remains close to that of Dubail so as not to forget that the customisation application is affiliated to this one. We have decided to keep the style simple and easy to use.*
