## 1. Introduction
This project combined Alpha's and Beta's Groups with the goal to create an android app for Dubail Paris who need a jewel customisation app.
The Alpha group managed the Beta group and Beta group developed the interface of app.
However, Alphas work on the Angular Project and 3D models of jewel who
 represent the request product of customer.
 The main goal is to offer our client an app with customisation display of jewel the customers want and letting them vusualize it.


## 2. Technologies Used
On this project, we used some software to develop and manage:
GitHub is useful to host our repository, push and pull some feature to all of our team's work.
Visual studio code is the development software with some useful features which help us for developing purposes; debug and create the app.
Angular is a TypeScript framework for web application, this framework
is useful as the development tool for this project.
Trello is an app used for managing and organizing our task and divide this for all the team. With deadlines, TO DOs, in progress, finish and out of scope  sections, it's the main managing tool used on this project.
## 3. GitHub
On GitHub repository, we have 3 branch, main, save and test.
Most features are commit on test branch.
3 folders are used, render, projectDubail and app.
Render is used for 3D render, test some feature on JavaScript with THREE.JS .
ProjectDubail is actually an Angular app by the Alpha Group. Combined with THREE.JS, Angular can display 3D model very well and it's usefull for the app feature in TypeScript.
The folder used by the Beta Group, is used for interface of app. This part used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
